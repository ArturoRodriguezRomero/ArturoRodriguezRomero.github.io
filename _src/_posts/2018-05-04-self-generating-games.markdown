extract: New interesting techniques to develop games.
---

Making games is **hard** and it takes a ton of **time**.

And people will get bored of repetitive systems very quickly. Sometimes this time is so short that making the game is not worth the effort.

So it makes sense for game developers to try and find new ways to generate gameplay and content without them actually having to make it all.

## Self Generating Game.

This are some of the techniques developers have come up with:

#### Emergent Behaviour.

A game is built by strict rules. The goal of Emergent Behaviour is for the game to generate new patterns from the rules of the game. Allow for new posibilities that the designers didn't have in mind when designing the game.

A game like [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/) has universal rules that the player can combine any way they want to.

You give the player enough control to come up with new things to do, without letting them loose.

#### Storytelling.

Usually the story in a game is a narrative set by the developers. The player has little to nothing to say on it. Sometimes the story has branching paths, the player may have choice in what path to take, but the story is already stablished since the beginning.

A game like [Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™](https://store.steampowered.com/app/241930/Middleearth_Shadow_of_Mordor/) tries to intruduce the idea of a player-driven-self-generating story with the *Nemesis System*. The player's actions can create a range of situations driven from a set of behaviours. The greater the number of behaviours, the greater the amount of different stories the player can create.

Even if this system is, like in Shadow of Mordor, not the main narrative of the game. By giving the player a **real role** in the game, they will get a real sense of say in a world. Something games rarely give to the player.

#### Placing players against each other.

By allowing players to battle each other, they will always find new, unexpected, ways to beat the other player.

This is great, it allows for creativity and imagination, but be careful, players love a challenge, but they **hate to lose**. Especially if they are matched with people of higher skill.

Competitive games will lead to frustration if there's no fun in the competition for any of the parts.

#### User generated content.

Most of the time, hopefully, the number of people playing your game will be higher than the number of people who developed it.

By allowing people to create more content for your game, with a level editor or with mod support, you are **adding new people to your staff** for *free*.

[Arma 3](https://arma3.com/) gives the players (almost) all the tools the developers use to make the game itself. This results is a ton of fan-made content.

If someone loves a game, they will love to make more content for it.
