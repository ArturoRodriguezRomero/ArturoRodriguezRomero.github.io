All games are about learning. You objective a as developer should be the same as the that of a teacher, **help people learn new things and develop new skills**. There are a few things that can help to increase your *student*'s learning and overall interest in your *subject*.

## 3 Things a Game Must Have

#### A Variable Feedback System.

A challenge shouldn't have a predictable outcome. The player's **rewards should be directly dependent of their performance** tackling the problem. Build the systems in your game with enough range of rewards depending of the skill of the player.

This is easy if the game has a valuable currency, you could give them money proportional to their skill, or if you can give them many different rewards or mutable ones, give them better loot if their score was high enough in the last challenge.

#### A Balanced Reward System.

A Variable Feedback System, the thing we just talk about before, is a good thing for your game, it rewards player for being skillful and encourages them to play more and become a better player.

But you also must have in mind less skillful player. You should find a balance in which experienced players don't get huge rewards by doing something they find trivial and, at the same time, give inexperience players an **adequate challenge** with an **adequate reward**

#### A Real Cost for Failure.

If failure is irrelevant, then the reward will be worthless. Giving failure a valuable cost encourages your players to become better. I will also highten the **feeling of accomplishment** they will get when they finally succeed in the challenge.

It will also induce players to try new things. If thing A doesn't work, they may try thing B. The feeling of beating a problem with something (*you think*) you came up on your own, is very valuable, and players love it.
