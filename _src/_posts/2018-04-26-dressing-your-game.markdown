Dressing is all the things in your game that aren't the *game itself*.

For example, dressing is the look of the level, the lore of the world, the voice of the characters, the sound of the weapons, etc. A game without dressing looks like a bunch of primitive shapes and collision volumes.

## Dressing Your Game.

Dressing is very important for players. It adds an interesting angle and hightens the game's immersion. It can even be a reason why someone starts playing your game.

But for what your *game* is concerned, dressing is irrelevant. **Dressing isn't what the game is about**. Your game will live or die on it's own, depending on how good the *game* is.

You shouldn't let the dressing be the designer of the game. Dressing should always adapt to the gameplay, not the other way around, and it shouldn't change how the game feels to play.

Your game pitch shouldn't be: 

> *"A cartoony looking 2D platformer in which you play as a humanized mouse who explores abandonded catacumbs all over a 1950's steampunk world invaded by an alien species"*.

Don't get me wrong, **that sounds awesome**, but you can't support a great dressing with a poorly, or even a not at all, designed game.

Start with the game's core, then find a dressing that fits the game and adds even more value to it. Don't let your game be limited by your artstyle, your story or how realistic a level should look. **Mold everything to support the gameplay**.
