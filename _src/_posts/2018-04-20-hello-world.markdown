### Welcome to the first ever Internet Blogâ„¢.

My name is Arturo and I'm a 20 year old dude from Madrid! That's the one in Spain, not the one in Kentucky, mind you.

I've been thinking about writting lately, so I've set up this blog with the help of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}.It was a pretty cool process, so I'm definitely going to write a post about it (EDIT: [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-04-21-jekyll-blog-tutorial %})'s the post ðŸ˜Š)

I'll be writting about Web Development, Game Design, Programming and all the other good things in life.

Hopefully you will like it as much as I enjoy writting it.

Here's a picture of my cousin's cat:
