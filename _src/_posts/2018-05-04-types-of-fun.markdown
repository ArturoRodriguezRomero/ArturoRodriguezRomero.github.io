## Types of Fun.

Let's go back to the basics, games are about learning. Most people learn in school through different **school subjects**.

We study *Math* in *Math class*, *History* in *History class*, *Chemistry* in *Chemistry class* and so on.

But why this division? Why do we separate Music from Literature, why don't we combine both subjects? Or Math and History?

Well, usually, different subjects appeal to a different part of the brain or, at the very least, are **radically different** to learn. This is because:

> **There are different types of intelligence.**

Some people have a natural skill in Math, others in Music. Some people are good at Sports, others are good at sharing Emotions.

Now let's apply this to games.

If we understand that fun comes from the process of **learning new skills and tackling challenges**, we should divide the types of fun by the type of intelligence they are seeking to fulfill.

#### Types of Intelligence.

The most common division of intelligence is the one by Howard Gardner ([here's the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences)) who separates intelligence into:

* **Musical-Rhythmic**: discerning sounds, pitch, tone, rhythm and timbre.
* **Visual-Spatial**: visualizing the world in 3D.
* **Verbal-Linguistic**: finding the right words to express what you mean.
* **Logical-Mathematical**: quantifying things, making hypotheses and proving them.
* **Bodily-Kinesthetic**: coordination between mind and body.
* **Interpersonal**: sensing people's feelings and motives.
* **Intrapersonal**: understading your own feelings and motives.
* **Naturalistic**: understanding living things and nature.

Don't think of this list as the be-all-end-all, this is what Gardner has been able to identify, but he, and lots of other people, are always looking for new types of intelligence (Read the Wikipedia article).

#### Intelligence in Games.

Most games are appealing to these types of intelligence:

* **Visual-Spatial** to navigate through the level.
* **Logical-Mathematical** to tackle puzzles.
* **Bodily-Kinesthetic** to control the game itself.

Some games add a few more:

* **Musical-Rhythmic** to discern enemy footsteps or sounds in the level.
* **Interpersonal** to understand character motivation in a story.

We usually think it's hard for games to appeal to other types of intelligence because **most games are about the player mastering something**. May it be killing demons in hell or jumping through a candy land full of pipes.

Don't be afraid of making something different. Players **crave new experiences**. Imagine opening their minds to a new range of skills to learn and develop.

Give your players a linguistic challenge, help them understand their own feelings, teach them about nature.
