Here's a list of things that you game should have if you want it to be *pretty good*.

## Making a Great Game.

#### Preparation.

Before the player is thrown into the challenge, they should be allowed to prepare for it. Give them time to assess the situation and make **valuable choices**. Their choice could be positive or negative, but having choice is always good for your game and rewarding for the player.

Think about games that give players choices before they try to overcome the challenge. Games like *Far Cry* allow the player to scout a base, mark the enemies and prepare their attack. If the player makes good choices they will be succesful. But it's important that if a player makes a bad decision, they should be punished in some way, or at the very least not rewarded at all.

> Choice is only good if it has real repercussions.

#### A sense of space.

Player should be inmersed in the game's world. This doesn't mean the world should be as realistic as possible, it means that the player should feel like **everything belongs there**. The level should be an interesting place for the player to play in.

If you remove all the gameplay elements from your game, allowing the player only to walk around, and the level is interesting enough for the player not to be bored, your are doing it right.

#### A solid core.

The game should be **inherently fun** to play. It should have a set of interesting rules and a series of problems to solve. There's usually a trade off between number of features and quality of features. A game could have:

* Lots of small game mechanics.
* A few very good game mechanics.

This really is a matter of time and resources. You could fill a huge game with tons of very good mechanics, but it will take an enormous amount of time.

#### A range of challenges.

The game should have enough content so the player can use all the game's mechanics. This means having different levels, weapons, vehicles, and so on.

There is a fine line between having too little and too much content in your game. You should find a **balance between quantity, diversity and quality**.

#### A range of abilities required to solve the encounter.

The player should have to use a set of different abilities to overcome a problem. Difficulty comes from the **conflict between different abilities** needed to overcome the challenge.

Imagine there's a game in which you can jump, and there's another game where you can shoot. Neither game is too hard or very interesting on its own. Now imagine a game in which you can jump and shoot at the same time. Imagine all the small rules you could introduce between these two abilities. You may have to jump to reload your gun or maybe if you shoot while in the air you go further.

This sounds much more difficult and much more fun.

#### Skill required in using the abilities.

The game's challenges should require the player to use their skills to overcome them. If the player fails to overcome the challenge, they should be punished or, at least, not rewarded. If the player succeses to overcome the problem, they should be given a **valuable reward**.

Players are really smart about optimizing, if you don't give them a reward, a reason to do something, they will just consider it irrelevant.
