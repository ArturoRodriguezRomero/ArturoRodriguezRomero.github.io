extract: Theory to know while adding story to your game or game to your story.

Nowadays most games come with a story. No matter how small the game is, it comes with a story for the player to experience. We used to see story in games as something extra, now it's an intrinsical part of it.

## Stories in Games.

When it comes to story, developers usually take one out of these two routes:

* **Game before Story**:
You are focused on making a fun game, but you still want to have some story to tell. You put the story between the gameplay moments or make it not interrupt the gameplay itself.
* **Story before Game**:
You are focused on delivering a great story to the player, but you still need to have the appereance of a game. You take away control from the player in order to make them experience what you have designed or you give the player little control to begin with.

Neither of these routes are wrong, but they should be **deliberate design choices**.

The problem is, most people don't play games for the story. Even if they think they do, and it may even be the reason why the start playing a game, **players keep *playing* a game because they like the *game***.

Stories in games are usually a reward for the player.

> You have been playing for 30 minutes, here's a little drop of story, you **narrative yunkie**!

A story can be a great complement for your game, it can heighten the experience to new levels and it can make the player different emotions that they would feel just playing a game.

That's the thing, a **story doesn't provide the same as a game**, it doesn's make the player feel the same emotions, it's critically different.

Let's see a comparision between regular stories and games:

| Games | Stories |
|---|---|
| Teach through experience | Teach in an indirect way |
| Good at objectification (Good vs Evil) | Good at empathy |
| Tend to simplify and classify | Tend to be subtle and blur the lines |
| Show people's actions | Show people's emotions |
| Help generate player narratives | Provide a set narrative |

Where and what you use the story in your game for is up to you, just make sure that this decision is **deliberate** and that your game and your story both benefit from having each other.

A good blend between game and story can be a delicious thing.
