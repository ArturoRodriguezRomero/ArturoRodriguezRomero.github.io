## What is a Game?

> Games are real life.

Sounds like a pretty cheap explanation, but don't panic, it will make sense at some point.

Try and remember the first game you played as a child. The very first one you can remember playing as a little kid.

Good, in my case it's probably *hide and seek*. I remember playing it at my nursery school with other kids when I was around 2~3.

Now, let's look for an explanation for this. **Why do children play to hide from each other?**

Let's go way back in time to when the human kind lived in caves and hunted for a living. Kids probably played *hide and seek* as much as kids do now, because it's training a basic instinct for humans. **Survival**. Whether they are hiding from a wolf or a human from another tribe.

Games like *hide and seek* train us for very **real life situations** and teach us very **real life skills**.

* Running.
* Tracking.
* Hiding.
* Observation.
* Ability to stay silent.

These are all useful skills. May it be 20.000 years ago or in 2018.

Games have the intrinsic value of teaching us skills in a controlled environment. **Games are practice**.

Let's go back to the "Games are real life" quote and let's be a little more accurate.

> Games are real life with lower stakes.

#### Games represent real things, usually in a simple, abstract way.

It would be imposible to represent real life in a game, that's why games are full of simple objects with simple abilities that follow simple rules. It's easier for the player to know what to do and what's happening.

Lately, I've been playing [Doorkickers (2014)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/248610/Door_Kickers){:target="_blank"}, and I find very interesting the feeling that such a simple looking game can give you. You really feel like a S.W.A.T squad storming into a house full of terrorists. Very similar to what I'd feel playing [Rainbow Six Siege (2015)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/359550/Tom_Clancys_Rainbow_Six_Siege/){:target="_blank"}, but in a very different kind of game.

The main difference between these games is the **level of abstraction**.

#### Games turn real objects into groups of discrete values.

Objects in games are **simplified and quantified**. This means that if you are fighting an enemy, you are not really fighting a soldier or a demon, you are fighting a set of attributes and abilities.
You are trying to lower their health in the most efficient way posible, you are trying not to get hit by their weapon because you know the damage it deals and you are careful to not be in range of their special ability.

A simple set of attributes and abilities are easier to learn and remember than a fully fleshed out character.

#### Games teach us through the subconscious.

Learning through a game is quite different from studying for an exam. You don't realize the skills you are developing while you practice them. And you may not even know that you have them, but in the proccess of playing, the subconscious part of your brain is developing a set of useful skills.

#### Games tend to teach simple things.

Most games teach through a very practical *action-reaction* way. This is usually limited to simple choices.
You shoot an enemy, it dies. You throw the ball, it may go in or it may not. You hit the brakes, you go slower.

**There is rarely a long term meaning to your actions.**

An exception to this would be a game like [Civilization](https://civilization.com/){:target="_blank"}. In a typical game of Civilization you make a ton of choices every turn that will define the later parts of the game.

You may invade a civilization's city in the beginning of the game, and 300 turns later the civilization may attack you in retaliation from your past deeds.
