        <p>The other day I finished <strong>A Theory of Fun for Game Design</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/raphkoster" target="_blank">Raph Koster</a> and I found it very interesting. It articulates what most player feel when we’ve been playing games for a long time.</p>

<p>I liked it so much that I’m going to give you my thoughts on it. Not a review nor a critique, but I’ll be giving you my take on it while sharing my point of view.</p>

<p>I will try to be broad and talk about general game design, but this series will be centered in <strong>videogame design</strong>.</p>

<p>Before we start, you can get the book on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Game-Design-Raph-Koster/dp/1449316034" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-our-brain-lazy">Why Is our Brain Lazy?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our brain is <strong>lazy</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why? Well it’s pretty simple, our brain doesn’t want to spend processing time in things we already know or in things that are not important to us.</p>

<p>Our brain <strong>assumes</strong> tons of things every day. It assumes how the pavement on the street you walk every day going to work is. It assumes where the trees are in your favorite park. Even though you don’t really know. This is your brain being <strong>energy efficient</strong>.</p>

<p>We apply <strong>patterns</strong> we already know to things we see for the first time. And if we don’t know any pattern to apply in the situation, we create it for future use. You don’t have to learn something new if you already know a similar pattern.</p>

  <figcaption>We see scary faces where there are none.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We uncunsciously abstract things to make them more easily recognizable. We don’t need to store a realistic memory of most things, we just keep a <strong>symbolic idea</strong> of it. You could thing of it as if our brain lowers the resolution of things we already know or that we don’t see as important.</p>

<p>This is a picture of a street I’ve walked a thousand times. I think I know it pretty well. But if you asked me what color a particular building is, I couldn’t tell you, my brain has tagged that information as not useful. But if it changed overnight, I would notice, or more like, my subconscious would notice.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/street.PNG" alt="A town street." /></p>

<p>This is how my subconscious sees this street.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blur-street.png" alt="A town street, seen by the subconscious. Blurry." /></p>

<p>This also applies to games. We sometimes call it <strong>muscle memory</strong>, even though muscles don’t have memory (that we know of). This really is your brain having internalized a movement, a reaction to an action. This is a very long term kind of memory.</p>

<p>Let’s say you played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank"><em>Counter Strike</em></a> many years ago and you were pretty good but you stopped playing a long time ago, it would be faster for you to become a good player again than if you had never played before.</p>
