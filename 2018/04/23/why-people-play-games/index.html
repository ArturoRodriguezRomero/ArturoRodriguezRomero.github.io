        <h2 id="why-people-play-games">Why people play games.</h2>

<p>There are many reason why people may play games, here are a few of them:</p>

<h4 id="to-have-fun">To have Fun.</h4>

<p>This is the main reason why people play games. It’s also the main reason why people start playing games.</p>

<p><strong>Games are inherently fun</strong>, if well design.</p>

<p>They can make you feel all sorts of real life emotions that affect us in real life ways. They can give you a real sense of satisfaction for your actions and can even get you into a <strong>state of flow</strong>.</p>

<p>In a state of flow you are using all your skills and knowledge to fulfill an objective. This happens in many creative activities, like painting, writing, woodworking, programming, etc. Times flies when you are <strong>in the zone</strong>, you feel like the best in the world at that activity. This state is where the best games can help you get.</p>

<h4 id="to-be-the-best">To be the Best.</h4>

<p>People usually start playing to be the best, or to win, when they have arrived a the <strong>last phase</strong> of a games learning lifecycle. They know everything the game has to offer and they have all the skills necessary to beat it. But they still want to keep playing, Whether to beat a high score or to get to a certain skill rank.</p>

<p>This usually results in a <strong>grind</strong>. It’s very hard work to keep playing a game for hours with very to none real skill development, but using all your abilities and knowledge to beat a tough competitor is very rewarding.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Becoming the best can be a game of its own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="to-experience-a-story">To experience a Story.</h4>

<p>This is a bit of a weird one. Because games can have two very different types of stories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stories crafted by the developers. Think <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/7670/BioShock/" target="_blank"><em>Bioshock</em></a>.</li>
  <li>Stories created by the players with opportunities given by the developers. Think <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank"><em>Minecraft</em></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The typical <em>story game</em> comes with a <strong>perfectly crafted story</strong> by the developers, which will hopefully make the player feel a certain way. <em>Bioshock</em> wants you to experience Rapture’s story and its characters through the eyes of your avatar. It’s very manufactured, and it works very well.</p>

<p>The more nuance way of telling a story is to allow the player to <strong>create their own narratives</strong> with their actions. In <em>Minecraft</em>, and similar very open world sandbox games, you make your own story, your decisions and actions will determine what kind of story you get and what you take with you when you are “finished”.</p>

<p>Some games have both types of stories. They have a narrative set by the developers and the gameplay also allows for a gret deal of improvisation and variation, and give the player a meaninful part and choice in the story.</p>

<h4 id="to-relax">To Relax.</h4>

<p>After they have completely beaten a game, and have adquired all the necessary skills needed to play it, some people still enjoy going back to it.</p>

<p>For some people it’s relaxing to play a game they have fully mastered and have a deep understanding of. They enjoy seeing their progresion after a long period of playing, it’s rewarding to see <strong>how far you’ve come</strong> in a game.</p>

  <figcaption>People enjoy playing <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a> even after having spent thousands of hours on it.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is no “right” way to play a game. Games should be able to have a story, be competitive or be infinitely replayable. But a game should always prioritize <strong>fun</strong> over everything else. Or have the story, the competitive aspect and the replayability support the systems that make the game fun.</p>
