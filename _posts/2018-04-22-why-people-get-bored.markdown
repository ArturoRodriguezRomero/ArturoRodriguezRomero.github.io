Learning is **awesome**. It gives you a hit of **endorphins**, it gives you **goosebumps** all over your body, it makes your brain go **wild**.

> The problem with learning is, once you've learnt something, **that's it**.

You can't unlearn something. Sure, you can forget it, but you can only get that hit of endorphins the first time around.

That's why we are always learning new stuff. We get bored of what we already know, so we look for something new. We are voracious learners. We get a subject, we learn everything we want to learn about it, and then we dispose of it.

### Why People get Bored?

**"I already know it!!"**

That's how some gifted children feel in their traditional schools, or how a senior university student feel the last months of class before graduation.

**"There's nothing new you can teach me!!"**

And they are right.

Let's take at look a classic children games:

* A game like *Catch* teaches us **Physical Coordination**.
* A game like *Rock, Paper, Scissors* teaches us **Chance**.
* A game like *Chess* teaches us **Strategy**.
* A game like *Tic, Tac, Toe* teaches us **Pattern Recognition**.

This is obvious for adults. But when you are a kid, these games are helping youe brain develop all sorts of skills without you even knowing.

The last game *Tic, Tac, Toe* has a very interesting characteristic. It's considered a [**futile game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futile_game). This means that if both players take the most optimal move, the game will always end in a tie.
