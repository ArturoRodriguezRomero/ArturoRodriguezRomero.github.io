The other day I finished **A Theory of Fun for Game Design** by [Raph Koster](https://twitter.com/raphkoster) and I found it very interesting. It articulates what most player feel when we've been playing games for a long time.

I liked it so much that I'm going to give you my thoughts on it. Not a review nor a critique, but something on the lines of a school appointment in which you have to read *One Hundred Years of Solitude* and later take a test on it, and you follow the general structure and share the points that stuck to you the most.

I will try to be broad and talk about general game design, but this series will be centered in **videogame design**.

Before we start, you can get the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Game-Design-Raph-Koster/dp/1449316034).

## What is a Game?

> Games are real life.

Sounds like a pretty cheap explanation, but don't panic, it will make sense at some point.

Try and remember the first game you played as a child. The very first one you can remember playing as a little kid.

Good, in my case it's probably *hide and seek*. I remember playing it at my nursery school with other kids when I was around 2~3.

Now, let's look for an explanation for this. **Why do children play to hide from each other?**

Let's go way back in time to when the human kind lived in caves and hunted for a living. Kids probably played *hide and seek* as much as kids do now, because it's training a basic instinct for humans. **Survival**. Whether they are hiding from a wolf or a human from another tribe.

Games like *hide and seek* train us for very **real life situations** and teach us very **real life skills**.

* Running.
* Tracking.
* Hiding.
* Observation.
* Ability to stay silent.

These are all useful skills. May it be 20.000 years ago or in 2018.

Games have the intrinsic value of teaching us skills in a controlled environment. **Games are practice**.

Let's go back to the "Games are real life" quote and let's be a little more accurate.

> Games are real life with lower stakes.
